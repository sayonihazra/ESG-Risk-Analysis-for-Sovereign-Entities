# ESG-Risk-Analysis-for-Sovereign-Entities
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of sovereign ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ratings data to evaluate the sustainability performance of nations. Through descriptive statistics, categorical-to-numeric transformations, and correlation analysis, the study examines how sub-dimensions like climate performance, education, governance, and working conditions influence overall ESG scores. Comparative and cluster analyses highlight regional performance patterns and group countries with similar profiles, while visualizations such as heatmaps and radar charts aid in intuitive interpretation. The objective is to identify ESG leaders and laggards, assess the drivers behind ESG ratings, and support evidence-based recommendations for re-rating and methodological enhancementsâ€”ultimately providing actionable insights for sovereign ESG risk evaluation and sustainable investment decisions.
