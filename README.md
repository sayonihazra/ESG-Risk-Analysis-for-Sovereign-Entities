# ESG-Risk-Analysis-for-Sovereign-Entities
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of sovereign ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ratings data to evaluate the sustainability performance of nations. Through descriptive statistics, categorical-to-numeric transformations, and correlation analysis, the study examines how sub-dimensions like climate performance, education, governance, and working conditions influence overall ESG scores. Comparative and cluster analyses highlight regional performance patterns and group countries with similar profiles, while visualizations such as heatmaps and radar charts aid in intuitive interpretation. The objective is to identify ESG leaders and laggards, assess the drivers behind ESG ratings, and support evidence-based recommendations for re-rating and methodological enhancements—ultimately providing actionable insights for sovereign ESG risk evaluation and sustainable investment decisions.
This ESG Sovereign Ratings analysis identifies patterns and disparities in national sustainability performance across environmental, social, and governance dimensions. The analysis reveals that Governance is the strongest driver of overall ESG scores, often aligning with high transparency, press freedom, and political participation metrics. Top ESG leaders, such as Bufferia, Bulgurdarest, Arnovia, Berzerkistan, and Auradon, consistently score high across all ESG pillars and demonstrate strong climate performance, robust social protections, and high women's representation in national governance. On the other hand, ESG laggards, including Amestris, Besźel, Bialya, Costa Luna, and Bowser's Kingdom, struggle with governance weaknesses, high inequality, and limited press freedom, which significantly drag down their overall ESG standing.
Moreover, the analysis highlights that gender inclusivity, especially women's participation in government and managerial roles, is strongly associated with higher social scores. Some countries also show imbalances, performing well in social indicators but poorly in governance or vice versa, suggesting the need for policy interventions. Outliers were detected using IQR analysis. Correlation and clustering analyses and visualization using heatmaps and bar charts further emphasize how climate and education factors moderately influence ESG ratings. These insights are crucial for policymakers, investors, and ESG analysts aiming to refine rating methodologies or prioritize developmental interventions.
